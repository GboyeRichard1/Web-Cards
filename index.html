            <h3>Light Energy Capture in Solar Cells</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to decreasing material costs, clever engineering tricks are pushing the efficiency of silicon solar cells closer to their theoretical maximum. In order for photons to be converted into energy, they must first collide with an electron.</p>
